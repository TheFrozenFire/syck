If the unit tests don't pass, notify me immediately.  This distribution
is tested on FreeBSD and Linux.  I don't release it unless the tests
pass on those machines.  If tests aren't passing, then that's a problem.

ABOUT

Syck is the Scripting YAML Cobbling Together a Parser Kit.  I don't
much care if the acronym works, as long as the library does!

The whole point of Syck is to make parsing and emitting YAML very
simple for scripting languages through C bindings.  It doesn't strive
to be a pull parser or very extendible.  It just is concerned with
loading a YAML document into a C structure which can be easily 
translated into a scripting language's internal native data type.

For example, in Ruby everything evaluates to a VALUE.  I merely
supply a handler to Syck that will take a SyckNode and transform
it into a Ruby VALUE.

A simple Ruby YAML::load could be built like so:

  static VALUE
  YAML_load( VALUE str )
  {
    SyckParser* parser;
    parser = syckParserCreate();
    syckSetHandler( parser, YAML_handler );
    ret = syckParse( parser, str );
    return ret;
  }

  static VALUE
  YAML_handler( SyckNode* node )
  {
    switch( node->kind )
    {
      case SYCK_MAP:
        VALUE key;
        VALUE h = rb_hash_new();
        for ( key = node->content[0]; key != null; key++ )
        {
          rb_hash_set( h, key, key++ );
        }
        return h;
      break;
    }
  }

If I can get this to work then it will be a no-brainer to bring
basic YAML serialization to PHP, Tcl, Cocoa, etc.
