about: >

  Syck is a YAML parser, an extension for scripting
  languages, written in C.  

  So what is YAML?  YAML is a new language for data.
  Describe objects in plain text.  Load the data into
  your scripting language as arrays, dictionaries,
  classes, or primitives.

status: >

  Syck is about 80% compliant with the YAML spec.  Syck currently
  has a few issues with type families before an mapping.  I've also
  noticed some whitespace issues.  The seq-in-map shortcut is not
  yet supported.

  The extensions are quite usable, though.  Ruby, PHP and Python
  can load from a string containing YAML.  Ruby also has support
  for stream loading from any IO object.

  This release also introduces the YAML.rb 0.50 source code into
  the Ruby extension.  Which means: YPath, emitting, Okay.

benchmarks: >

  Syck is quite speedy, although not as swift as most language's
  native serialization.

  Syck runs at about:

  30-35% of the speed of Ruby's Marshal.
  35-90% of the speed of PHP's deserialize().
  600% of the speed of Python's Pickle.
  33-40% of the speed of Python's cPickle.

  (Based on various types of structured data.)

installation: >

  Syck contains working extensions for the Ruby, PHP, and Python
  languages.  Each requires compilation of the libsyck library,
  followed by compilation of the extension.

  To compile libsyck, first download libsyck.

    tar xzvf syck-0.25.tar.gz
    cd syck-0.25
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

  To install the Ruby extension:

    cd ext/ruby
    ruby install.rb config
    ruby install.rb setup
    sudo ruby install.rb install

  To install the Python extension:

    cd ext/python
    python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install

  To install the PHP extension:

    sh make_module.sh
    sudo make install (if you weren't root during make_module.sh)
    php -q syck.php
