    CHANGELOG: Added.

    lib/Makefile.am: re2c compiling with bit vectors now.

    lib/syck.c: clear parser on init. thanks, ts. [ruby-core:02931]

    lib/implicit.re: 
    - added sexagecimal float#base60.

    lib/token.re: 
    - using newline_len to handline CR-LFs.  
      "\000" was showing up on folded blocks which
      stopped at EOF. 

    - buffer underflow. thanks, ts. [ruby-core:02929]

    - indentation absolutely ignored when processing flow collections.

    - plain scalars are trimmed if indentation follows in an ambiguous
      flow collection.

    - fixed problem with comments sharing line with opening of block sequence.

    ext/ruby/lib/yaml/compat.rb: moved all ruby 1.6 -> ruby 1.8
      handling into compat.rb.

    ext/ruby/lib/yaml/baseemitter.rb: 
    - simpler flow block code.

    - was forcing a mod value of zero at times, which kept 
      some blocks from getting indentation.

    ext/ruby/lib/yaml/rubytypes.rb: exceptions were using an older
      YAML.object_maker. [ruby-core:03080]
       
    ext/ruby/lib/yaml.rb: 
    - added YAML::load_file, YAML::parse_file.
    - added rdoc to beginning of lib.

    ext/ruby/ext/syck/rubyext.c: 
    - set buffer after Data_Wrap_Struct to avoid possible GC. [ruby-talk:104835]
    - added float#base60 handling.

    ext/ruby/yts/YtsSpecificationExamples.yml: new examples from the 1.0
      working draft. [http://yaml.org/spec/]
